The Food-Biomarker Ontology is an ontology composed of two interconnected sub-ontologies. One is a “Food Ontology” consisting of raw foods and prepared foods while the second is a “Biomarker Ontology” containing food intake biomarkers classified by their chemical classes. 

The FOBI is available in both OWL (Web Ontology Language) and OBO (Open Biomedical Ontologies) formats.
